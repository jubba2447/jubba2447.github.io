<p>Welcome to my first web page! My name is Jessica and I am a student at CCSF, the City College of San Francisco. I enjoy taking classes at the City College because most are offered online, and I am able to fit them into my busy schedule. My undergraduate degree is in Anthropologie, though I wished I had majored in Computer Science.  City College has helped me bridge the gap between what I know and what I want to know. Hope you enjoy my very first web page!</p>
<p>My absolute favorite website for learning web programming (and learning in general!) is <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. It is a great place to start for beginners, and offers a variety of courses.  I've used it as a refresher for Calculus as well as Computer Programming. The format is easy follow, and I love to earn those badges as I progress.  And the best thing about it - it's free!</p>
<p>Another great resource for help is CCSF's own 
 <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#leftnav" target="_blank">CCSF Counseling</a>. Here you'll find a number of different resources available based on your needs, whether it be for meeting degree requirements, receiving career guidance, or simply learning good study skills.</p>

<h3>Some Other Good Links</h3>

	<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>: Codecademy offers courses in a number of different web development and computer programming languages.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a>: Coursera doesn't really offer hands-on practice, but it does have video tutorials on about any topic you can imagine.  It's good to know the big picture about what makes good web development, and not just the coding details.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com" target="_blank">HTML&CSS Book</a>: This is more a reference to a beautiful and well-organized book I found.  Their website also provides some good companion videos and tools. </li>
